Introduction 
------------

Drupal agencies, freelancers, site builders and even Drupal site owners do 
need DRD (Drupal Remote Dashboard) because it is the one and only solution that 
provides a non-intrusive insight into any number of remote Drupal sites without 
the need of any third party service.

No matter where the Drupal sites are hosted and regardless of any configuration 
or deployment specifics, DRD is able to monitor and manage them all at once. 
The dashboard is build for Drupal 8, the monitored remote sites are supported 
on Drupal 6, 7 and 8.

Dependencies
------------

The main DRD module requires taxonomy, update and views, all three from Drupal core, and in 
addition a couple of contrib modules such as 
[EVA](https://www.drupal.org/project/eva) and 
[Key value field](https://www.drupal.org/project/key_value_field). 
Other than that, it has no special requirements.

Each remote Drupal site that should be monitored, requires the 
[DRD Agent](https://www.drupal.org/project/drd_agent) module installed and 
enabled. This module is a simple wrapper around the dynamically loaded DRD 
library which brings all the code that needs to be executed remotely.

Of course, security and privacy comes first. And we've addressed that in the 
product architecture from day one. DRD brings the best possible convenience 
without compromising security or privacy. Read more and discuss about that 
topic in the [Security chapter](https://www.drupal.org/node/2839478) of the 
documentation.
